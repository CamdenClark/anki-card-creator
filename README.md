# anki card creator

anki card creator is a frontend-only website that helps you create anki cards from prompts using gpt.

I made this for myself and figured it could be useful to others so I am deploying it for feedback.

It is deployed at https://anki-card-creator.pages.dev

We don't store anything except in local storage.

## Development

`npm ci` and then `vite` should get you going!
